This mod will give you the option of which bosses you want to spawn on each map.

Now multiple example config files are included!  Just copy whichever you wish to use over the configs folder,
and overwrite the existing files to use.
If you come up with a cool config please share it in the comments, or feel free to message it to me, I may include it in future releases.

The default config will set any bosses that normally spawn on the map to 100% with no other changes (this is the same as Standard Backup)
Spicy config give a 20% chance for every boss to spawn on each map, a 20% chance to spawn a raider, a rogue, a bloodhund or a crazed scav group, and spawns a boss horde of between 3 and 7 bosses.
BossesWithFriends config will set any bosses that normally spawn on the map to 100% and they will bring a friend.
Horde config will spawn some custom made hordes to ruin your day (good example on building custom hordes)
