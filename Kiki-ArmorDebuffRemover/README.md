This mod allows you to set the mouse aim, movement speed, or ergonomic penalty penalty of armor, rigs or helmets a % of your choosing.
At 0 they will be removed completely. 50, halved.  200, doubled.  For example. 
Set the options you want in config.json.
Thanks to X.Fight for the suggestion, and as always to Ereshkigal for the mod framework.
Credit to MusicManiac for changing the config to a % based system.
