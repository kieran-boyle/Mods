Allows you to edit the health values for the players (PMC and Scav) each type AI or boss individually.
This can be done in a couple of ways.  bodyPartMode (if enabled) will directly set the health values of each bodypart to its corresponding config option.
If disabled then the health value will be multiplied by the healthMultiplier instead (where 1 is default, 2 is double, 0.5 is half etc)
If AllEqualToPlayer is set to true, then all bots will have their health values set to the same as the player 
(following whatever bodypart or multiplier settings are applied to the player.)

if extraHealthPerLevel enabled is set to true, the player will gain extra health for each of the body parts values, multiplied by the profiles level. (Works for player scav too)
The values in the config are from the default player health values.  Everything is disabled by default.

Extra configs contains a backup of the original config, as well as a config from PattyPN which makes bosses die to a single headshot (Appart from Killa and Tagilla ), but balances them individually.
To use a config from the extra configs folder.  Copy, paste and overwrite the config/config.json.
If you come up with an interesting config, give me a shout and I may include it in future releases.

***Notice***
Due to the profile not being created yet, you will need to restart the game following fresh profile creation for player health changes to take effect.
